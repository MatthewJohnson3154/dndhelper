## A tool for assisting with the character creation process of Dungeons & Dragons 5e.

Currently the only feature is auto generating a 6x6 grid of stat rolls (roll 4d6, drop lowest, sum the rest) to use for selecting your character stats. You would then choose any row or column of your choice for your character and assign the numbers in any order to your stats (i.e. Strength, Intelligence, etc.)

_This way of generating random character stats was introduced to me by my friend and coworker [Matt](https://github.com/mjtischler)_
